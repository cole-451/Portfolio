                    This is where all of my projects would go. I've had a few over the years, spanning across multiple engines and languages.
                    For the purposes of this assignment, I suppose I'll talk about one of them!

                    <h2>Project Blasted</h2>
                    <p>
                        What started out as a simple little beat-em-up project eventually turned into one of the few projects I was genuinely
                        passionate about during high school. It may not be pretty, and is honestly working around Unreal 5's massive bloat
                        issues, but I really enjoyed what I was able to do for this.
