            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hello!</strong> I'm a aspiring game dev from Westland, Michigan. When it comes to game design, I feel that if your heart isn't in it, it's not worth it.
                    I have multiple languages under my belt, but I now especially understand C++ and Python thanks to college and my old high school days. Since then, I have been making games
                    since, and I hopefully will continue to.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides that, I enjoy bowling, older video games, and a lot of music. I try my best to really branch out and
                    find new things to read or listen to, and at least hope that I can try and make a difference in the industry, where
                    I feel like gaming has become more of a tool for companies to generate as much profit as possible before pulling the plug.
                </p>
